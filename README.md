# Arduino Fireflies

This can be built on a perfboard (see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Standalone), which I cut to fit inside the mouth of a mason jar. It can be powered by 2 AA batteries as long as your ATmega chip has a 3.3v/8Mhz bootloader. I used dried Spanish moss to fill the jar. Battery life is ~6 months.
